1. Sponsors.
The MrBeast Tesla Giveaway Sweepstakes (“Sweepstakes”) is sponsored by MrBeastYouTube, LLC,
740 Greenville Blvd SE, STE 400-163 Greenville, NC 27858 USA (“Sponsor”). This Sweepstakes is not
sponsored, endorsed, administrated by, or associated with Google, YouTube, Meta, Instagram, TikTok, X,
or Tesla, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, none of these entities shall have any
liability to any person in connection with or arising out of the Sweepstakes, and each Entrant releases
such entities from any and all liability in relation to their Sweepstakes participation.

3. Eligibility.
The Sweepstakes is open only to consumers who are legal residents of the U.S. (including D.C.; but
excluding NY and FL), Australia, Canada, Chile, metropolitan France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico,
South Korea, and the United Kingdom (“Jurisdictions”), who are at least 18 years of age or the legal age
of majority in their country, state, or jurisdiction of residence, whichever is older, at the time of entry and
are physically located in one of the above-referenced Jurisdictions (“Entrant”). Proof of residency and
age may be required.

Employees, officers, and directors of Sponsor or any of its parents, affiliates, subsidiaries,
representatives, agents, consultants, contractors, legal counsel, advertising, public relations, promotional,
fulfillment, and marketing agencies (collectively, “Sweepstakes Entities”) and members of their
immediate families (parents, legal guardians, children, grandparents, grandchildren, spouses or siblings
and their respective spouses, regardless of where they live) and those living in their same households,
whether or not legally related, are not eligible to enter or win the Sweepstakes.

Participation in the Sweepstakes constitutes Entrant’s full and unconditional agreement to these Official
Rules and to Sponsor’s decisions, which are final and binding in all matters related to the Sweepstakes.
Winning a prize is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements, as set forth herein. Sponsor reserves the
right to verify eligibility of winners.

5. Entry Period.
Sweepstakes begins at 12:00PM Eastern Time (“ET”) (4:00pm UTC) on May 7, 2024 when Sponsor
creates and publishes a post under the @MrBeast account on Instagram (“Social Media Post”) and ends
at 11:59PM ET (3:59AM UTC) on May 10, 2024 (“Entry Period”). Sponsor’s computer is the official time
keeping device for the Sweepstakes.

6. How to Enter.
Sweepstakes participation requires (i) access to the internet and (ii) a valid account on Instagram. It is
free to create an account on Instagram, and any standard internet connection is sufficient. Internet
access, phone, and usage charges imposed by your online or mobile service provider(s) may apply; no
further charges will be imposed during participation.

To enter the Sweepstakes, complete the following steps during the Entry Period:

● Log in to your Instagram account;
● Locate the applicable Social Media Post on the @MrBeast page;
● “Like” the Social Media Post;
● In the “comment” section, post one (1) comment and tag two (2) friends.

Please note: The content of your comment will not be judged and will have no effect on your entry or your
chances of winning a prize. Multiple shares/reposts will not increase your chances of winning.
Upon completion of the above required steps, Entrant will receive one (1) entry (“Entry”) into the
Sweepstakes. LIMIT ONE ENTRY PER PERSON. ADDITIONAL ENTRIES SUBMITTED IN EXCESS OF
THIS LIMITATION BY THE SAME PERSON WILL BE DISQUALIFIED.

By submitting an Entry, you agree that Sponsor or its designees may contact you via direct message on
Instagram and/or tag you on Sponsor’s Instagram page.

Entries must be submitted by Entrant. Automated or bulk Entries or Entries submitted by third parties will
be disqualified. Any attempt by any Entrant to obtain more than the stated number of Entries by using
multiple and/or different identities, forms, registrations, email addresses, login, or any other methods will
void that Entry, and Entrant may be disqualified at Sponsor’s discretion.

Multiple Entrants are not permitted to share the same Instagram account. In the event of a dispute as to
the identity of an Entrant, the authorized account holder of the Instagram handle used to enter the
Sweepstakes will be deemed to be the Entrant. The “authorized account holder” is the natural person
assigned a social media handle by Instagram. Sponsor, at its discretion, may require a potential winner to
show proof of being the authorized account holder or forfeit the prize. If a dispute cannot be resolved to
Sponsor’s reasonable satisfaction, the Entry will be deemed ineligible. Entries specifying an invalid,
non-working, or inactive Instagram handle will be disqualified and ineligible to win.

All information or steps required by these Official Rules must be completed and provided to be eligible.
Incomplete, illegible, corrupted, or untimely Entries are void and will be disqualified. Sponsor is not
responsible for: (i) lost, late, incomplete, damaged, misdirected, misplaced, stolen, tampered with,
deleted, illegible, or invalid Entries; (ii) any expenses incurred in the creation and submission of any Entry;
or (iii) lost, interrupted, or unavailable network, server, or other connections, garbled transmissions or
miscommunications, telephone transmission problems; computer or software malfunctions or damage to
a user’s computer equipment (software or hardware); technical failures; or other errors or malfunctions of
any kind whether human, mechanical, electronic, or otherwise. Proof of sending or submission of Entry
will not be deemed proof of receipt by Sponsor.

Entries, comments, and any other content submitted or uploaded to any social media site or other public
site in connection with the Sweepstakes (“Content Submissions”) may not contain, depict, or show any
content that: (i) is sexually explicit or suggestive, offensive, lewd, profane, obscene; (ii) promotes any
activities that may appear unsafe or dangerous, or any political agenda or message; (iii)
defames, misrepresents or contains disparaging remarks about Sponsor or other companies; (iv) contains
any personal identification, such as license plate numbers, last names (first names are permitted), e-mail
or street addresses for any person, or otherwise infringes on the privacy of any person other than an
Entrant; (v) communicates messages or images inconsistent with the positive image and good will of
Sponsor’s brand; and/or (vii) violates any law. Any Content Submissions that contain such content will be
disqualified. Sponsor reserves the right in its sole and unfettered discretion to disqualify any Content
Submission that it believes is inappropriate, that does not comply with these Official Rules, or that is not
consistent with the spirit or theme of the Sweepstakes.

5. Selection of Winners.
On or about May 11, 2024, Sponsor (or Sponsor’s designee) will select the names of twenty-six (26)
potential prize winners (each, a “Potential Prize Winner”) in a random drawing from among all eligible
Entries received during the Entry Period. The odds of winning are based on the number of eligible Entries
received.

Potential Prize Winners will be notified by Instagram direct message and/or comment within three (3)
business days following the drawing (“Notification”). It is an Entrant’s responsibility to monitor their
Instagram account to see if they are a Potential Prize Winner. Sponsor is not responsible for and shall not
be liable for late, lost, damaged, intercepted, misdirected, or unsuccessful efforts to notify Potential Prize
Winners.

Potential Prize Winners will be required to sign and return a Declaration of Eligibility and Liability/Publicity
Release or other documents that Sponsor deems necessary to confirm eligibility and, unless prohibited by
law, obtain a liability/publicity release. Potential Prize Winners in Canada and Mexico will be required to
correctly answer a time-limited mathematical skill-testing question without mechanical or other aid. Failure
to return any required document by the date requested, or, Entrants in Canada and Mexico, to correctly
answer the mathematical skill-testing question, will deem the applicable Potential Prize Winner ineligible,
and their Prize will be forfeited.

If Sponsor is unable to contact a Potential Prize Winner, or a Potential Prize Winner has not responded
within 72 hours after the Notification has been sent, is not in compliance with these Official Rules, fails to
return any required document, correctly answer the mathematical skill-testing question, or declines to
accept the prize for any reason prior to award, their prize will be forfeited and, in Sponsor’s discretion, an
alternate winner may be selected in a random drawing from among all remaining eligible Entries, under
the same conditions mentioned above. Only one alternate drawing will be held, after which any remaining
prizes will remain un-rewarded.

ALL POTENTIAL PRIZE WINNERS ARE SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY SPONSOR, WHOSE
DECISIONS ARE FINAL AND BINDING IN ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE SWEEPSTAKES. A
POTENTIAL PRIZE WINNER IS NOT A WINNER OF ANY PRIZE UNLESS AND UNTIL THEIR
ELIGIBILITY HAS BEEN VERIFIED, AND POTENTIAL PRIZE WINNER HAS BEEN NOTIFIED THAT
VERIFICATION IS COMPLETE.

7. Prizes and Restrictions.
A total of twenty-six (26) prizes will be available to be awarded during the Sweepstakes as follows:

● One (1) grand prize (“Grand Prize”), consisting of a 2024 Tesla Cybertruck or One Hundred
Twenty Thousand Dollars ($120,000 USD) cash prize. Approximate retail value (“ARV”):
$120,000 USD
● Twenty-five (25) first place prizes (“First Place Prize”), each consisting of one (1) Tesla Model 3
or Thirty-Nine Thousand Dollars ($39,000 USD) cash prize. ARV: $39,000 USD

A winner will have the option to accept the cash prize stated above in lieu of the prize vehicle. In certain
jurisdictions, based on licensing, import, or other legal or distribution restrictions, vehicle may
not be able to be delivered. In such cases, the winner will be required to accept the stated cash
prize in lieu of the vehicle. LIMIT ONE (1) PRIZE PER PERSON. Any difference between ARV and
actual value of prize will not be awarded.

Winners will not be eligible for any cash rebate programs associated with the vehicle. Sponsor will
determine the style as well as interior/exterior colors of the vehicle, at its sole discretion. Winner will be
solely responsible for all title, license, registration, dealer preparation, destination, and handling
charges or fees, any additional equipment/accessories not specified above (this includes
conversion of manual transmission to automatic transmission), insurance, gasoline, vehicle
maintenance and all other fees and expenses associated with the receipt and use of the prize. At
Sponsor’s sole discretion, winner may be required to show proof of valid insurance and driver’s license
prior to receipt of vehicle. Winner must take delivery of vehicle at a location and time of Sponsor’s sole
choosing. To the maximum extent permissible by law, neither Sponsor, nor the vehicle manufacturer, has
made, nor is responsible or liable for, any warranty, representation, or guarantee, express or implied, in
fact or law, relative to the prize vehicle, including but not limited to its quality, mechanical condition, or
fitness. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the prize vehicle may include the manufacturer’s standard vehicle
limited warranty, as stated in the vehicle’s owner’s guide. Prize vehicle may differ from what is depicted in
Sweepstakes advertising. Sponsor reserves the right to delay vehicle delivery or substitute a similar
vehicle of equal or greater value should the vehicle as described be unavailable for any reason.

The actual value of any prize awarded may be taxable as income, and all applicable local, state,
provincial, and federal taxes related to the acceptance and/or use of prize shall be the sole responsibility
of the winner. Where applicable, winners may be required to provide Sponsor with a valid social security
number, tax identification number, or equivalent information, as required by applicable law in winner’s
Jurisdiction of residence, for tax reporting purposes before the Prize will be awarded. FOR WINNERS
RESIDING IN THE U.S: As the value of the prize exceeds $600 USD, Sponsor must report the value to
the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and will issue an IRS Form 1099 to the winner(s) for the value of the
prize received.

Except as specifically provided herein, prizes cannot be substituted, assigned, transferred, or redeemed
for cash. Sponsor will not replace any lost or stolen prizes or components thereof. Prizes cannot be used
in conjunction with any other promotion or offer.

All prize details not specified in these Official Rules will be determined in Sponsor’s sole and absolute
discretion. Prize details are subject to change, and Sponsor will provide Entrants with reasonable notice
of any change to the prize details. Unclaimed prizes will be forfeited.

7. General Conditions.
This Sweepstakes is governed by the laws of the United States. Subject to reasonable prior notice to
Entrants, Sponsor reserves the right to cancel, suspend, and/or modify the Sweepstakes, or any part of it,
if any fraud, technical failures, or any other factor beyond Sponsor’s reasonable control impairs the
integrity or proper functioning of the Sweepstakes, as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion.
Sponsor’s failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.

8. WARNING.

WEBSITE OR UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION OF THE SWEEPSTAKES MAY BE A
VIOLATION OF CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LAW, AND SHOULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE MADE, SPONSOR
